Problem Statement:
"A BOT with self-learning capability using modern natural language processing (NLP) or deep learning, along with transliteration and cognitive capabilities. The bot should intelligently score the relevancy of answers over time and respond to technical and non-technical users differently based on their technical ability."

Approach to Solution:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning:

Use NLP models like OpenAI's GPT models, Google's BERT, or Hugging Face Transformers to understand and generate human-like responses.
Deep learning (using RNNs or LSTM) can help the bot recognize patterns in data over time and improve through user interactions.
User Profiling (Technical and Non-Technical Users):

Collect information on the user's technical expertise based on their past queries or answers.
Assign a score to each user (technical ability index), which helps the bot respond differently to technical and non-technical users.
Non-technical users get simplified explanations, while technical users receive more in-depth, jargon-heavy responses.
Self-Learning Capability:

Implement a reinforcement learning framework where the bot learns from user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down or specific feedback).
Use user interactions to adjust the bot’s answer relevancy score over time. This can be done by retraining the bot on successful queries or using feedback loops.
Transliteration Cognitive Capability:

Incorporate a transliteration model that allows users to type in one language and converts it to another (e.g., typing Hindi phonetically in English, and the bot understanding/responding in Hindi).
You can leverage libraries like Google's transliteration API or language models to handle this.
Architecture Overview:
Input Layer: User input is processed through the NLP model.
User Profiling: A classifier distinguishes between technical and non-technical users.
Answer Generation: Based on the user’s query, the bot generates different types of responses (simplified or technical).
Self-learning/Reinforcement Learning: Answers are scored, and the bot adjusts its response accuracy based on feedback.
Transliteration Layer: For non-English queries, transliteration is applied, and the bot responds in the required language.
Example Steps to Implement:
Build the NLP Model:

Start with a pretrained model (e.g., GPT or BERT).
Fine-tune the model using your dataset of technical and non-technical queries.
User Profiling Mechanism:

Implement a simple classifier that categorizes users based on their technical knowledge using their query patterns.
Example: Use word embedding or semantic similarity to classify if a query is technical or non-technical.
Answer Generation:

Write functions that generate technical and non-technical answers.
Based on user profiling, adjust the depth of the response.
Reinforcement Learning for Self-Learning:

After each response, ask the user for feedback (e.g., was this helpful?).
Store feedback and improve answer relevancy using a scoring algorithm. A simple Q-learning mechanism can be implemented to adjust response quality.
Transliteration:

Use a transliteration service to handle queries in different languages.
Example: Python libraries like indic_transliteration can transliterate between languages.
